//! A simple CMake package finder.
//!
//! This crate is intended to be used in [cargo build scripts][cargo_build_script] to obtain
//! information about and existing system [CMake package][cmake_package] and [CMake targets][cmake_target]
//! defined in the package, such as include directories and link libraries for individual
//! CMake targets defined in the package.
//!
//! The crate runs the `cmake` command in the background to query the system for the package
//! and to extract the necessary information, which means that in order for this crate to work,
//! the `cmake` executable must be located the system [`PATH`][wiki_path]. CMake version
//! [3.19][CMAKE_MIN_VERSION] or newer is required for this crate to work.
//!
//! The entry point for the crate is the [`find_package()`] function that returns a builder,
//! which you can use to specify further constraints on the package ([version][FindPackageBuilder::version]
//! or [components][FindPackageBuilder::components]). Once you call the [`find()`][FindPackageBuilder::find]
//! method on the builder, the crate will try to find the package on the system or return an
//! error. If the package is found, an instance of the [`CMakePackage`] struct is returned that
//! contains information about the package. Using its [`target()`][CMakePackage::target] method,
//! you can query information about individual CMake targets defined in the package.
//!
//! If you want to make your dependency on CMake optional, you can use the [`find_cmake()`]
//! function to check that a suitable version of CMake is found on the system and then decide
//! how to proceed yourself. It is not necessary to call the function before using [`find_package()`].
//!
//! # Example
//! ```no_run
//! use cmake_package::find_package;
//!
//! let package = find_package("OpenSSL").version("1.0").find();
//! let target = match package {
//!     Err(_) => panic!("OpenSSL>=1.0 not found"),
//!     Ok(package) => {
//!         package.target("OpenSSL::SSL").unwrap()
//!     }
//! };
//!
//! println!("Include directories: {:?}", target.include_directories);
//! target.link();
//! ```
//!
//! # How Does it Work?
//!
//! When you call [`FindPackageBuilder::find()`], the crate will create a temporary directory
//! with a `CMakeLists.txt` file that contains actual [`find_package()`][cmake_find_package]
//! command to search for the package. The crate will then run actual `cmake` command in the
//! temporary directory to let CMake find the package. The `CMakeLists.txt` then writes the
//! information about the package into a JSON file that is then read by this crate to produce
//! the [`CMakePackage`].
//!
//! When a target is queried using the [`CMakePackage::target()`] method, the crate runs the
//! CMake command again the same directory, but this time the `CMakeLists.txt` attempts to locate
//! the specified CMake target and list all its (relevant) properties and properties of all its
//! transitive dependencies. The result is again written into a JSON file that is then processed
//! by the crate to produce the [`CMakeTarget`] instance.
//!
//! # Known Limitations
//!
//! The crate currently supporst primarily linking against shared libraries. Linking against
//! static libraries is not tested and may not work as expected. The crate currently does not
//! support linking against MacOS frameworks.
//!
//! [CMake generator expressions][cmake_generator_expr] are not supported in property values
//! right now, because they are evaluated at later stage of the build, not during the "configure"
//! phase of CMake, which is what this crate does. Some generator expressions could be supported
//! by the crate in the future (e.g. by evaluating them ourselves).
//!
//! There's currently no way to customize the `CMakeLists.txt` file that is used to query the
//! package or the target in order to extract non-standard properties or variables set by
//! the CMake package. This may be addressed in the future.
